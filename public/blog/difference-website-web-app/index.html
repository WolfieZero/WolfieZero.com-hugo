<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m asked a question in various forms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is a web app and what is a website?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure not a lot of web developers do struggle with this question. It&rsquo;s an interesting question as the two aren&rsquo;t exclusive. There isn&rsquo;t a rule that says what each one is in general. So I&rsquo;m going to try to lay down my thoughts on the subject and how I differentiate them. This is <strong>just my opinion</strong>, remember that!</p>

<h2 id="website">Website</h2>

<p>A website is content based. The most important thing on it is text and pictures that it shows on load. When we strip down a website to the core layer, the HTML, we can still understand what we are doing on a page. Any design or functionality, other than links, that the page provides is a bonus.</p>

<p>This, to me, is a simple build process. We need to make sure that at the most basic level the content makes sense without any other formatting.</p>

<p>Looking at things from a traditional view. A website needs to be accessible to all; disabled, able-bodied and even bots. So the solution needs that basic approach. Websites should be manipulative.</p>

<h2 id="web-app">Web App</h2>

<p>A web app is more complicated as it&rsquo;s function driven so to give correct feedback to the user. It relies on functionality to show that information. A user interacting with a page to gain insight. Developers may build using a single-page application framework so they could be an app. Keep in mind, sometimes developers use these for websites. If that&rsquo;s the case, the site should still fall back to a non-JS option.</p>

<p>Apps are bespoke to the use-case and designed to work in a particular way. These approaches need a lot of thought as we are almost locking the user into a particular flow. An app should be easier to use, in that the use-case needed fixing so the app solves this to improve user feedback. If I&rsquo;m designing an app for a visual impaired user then I&rsquo;ll add features that make it more accessible. A website should always be accessible otherwise I&rsquo;m breaking the openness of the web. In theory, you&rsquo;re not adding so much but keeping things simple.</p>

<h2 id="close-enough">Close Enough?</h2>

<p>So why think of this differentiation and feel the need to separate the two? It&rsquo;s more a development approach for me and how I should approach a problem. Can I fix it using something like JavaScript or tricky CSS? Do I have to make sure the solution is simple or could I take more away?</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t challenged this idea so if you think it&rsquo;s wrong or have another interpretation then let me hear it. Send me a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/WolfieZero">Twitter (@WolfieZero)</a> with your thoughts on what&rsquo;s define&rsquo;s web app or a site? Or maybe there isn&rsquo;t a difference?</p>

<p>As I said, it&rsquo;s a question that pops up a lot. I&rsquo;ve seen a change in development processes when it&rsquo;s stated as one or the other. Again, this isn&rsquo;t a perfect rule nor a de facto response. This is more just my ideas on what I think and how I make the split.</p>
