What was used to make this site? If you don't want to look at the [Github repo][1] then I'll list it all out here for you.

WolfieZero.com is a JAMstack site. The generator of choice is [Hugo][2] and hosted with [Netlify][3].

The theme is completely bespoke, but you can [steal it][1] if you really want, but give me attribution!

Fonts used are:

- [Exo][4] for the branded headers
- [Open Sans][5] for the main body type
- [Source Code Pro][6] for the monospaced stuff

[Sass][7] was used to build the CSS with my [Sketal Sass][8] boilerplate as a framework. All the effects seen are done with CSS.

[Webpack][9] is used to build the project, Sass, and JS. It's also used to run as a dev server.

Page loads are speed up using [Turbolinks][10].

Social icons (SVGs) are from [Picons][11].
